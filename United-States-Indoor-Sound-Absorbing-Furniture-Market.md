Household use is a major contributor to the market as consumers increasingly invest in home furniture that can reduce noise levels and provide a more peaceful living environment. This segment includes sound-absorbing furniture such as sofas, armchairs, bookshelves, and other household items designed to help manage acoustic comfort. Given the increasing focus on home offices, entertainment areas, and general relaxation spaces, households are more likely to incorporate these types of furniture into their design to create a quieter, more harmonious atmosphere. These products are particularly popular in urban areas where noise pollution levels are higher, and sound absorption can help mitigate the effects of external noises, contributing to better sleep quality and overall health. As consumers prioritize comfort and tranquility, the demand for sound-absorbing furniture in residential applications is poised to rise further.</p> <p>Business use represents another significant segment of the indoor sound-absorbing furniture market, primarily driven by the growing emphasis on creating productive workspaces.

Sound-absorbing furniture used in business environments includes acoustic panels, desk dividers, and upholstered furniture that absorbs noise and prevents it from reverberating through the space. As companies seek to improve the overall employee experience and reduce workplace stress, these products serve as effective solutions to maintain a quiet and focused environment. Furthermore, sound-absorbing furniture is being incorporated into meeting rooms, lounges, and reception areas, aligning with the broader trend toward enhancing workplace well-being. With the ongoing shift toward hybrid work models and more flexible office spaces, the demand for sound-absorbing furniture in business settings is expected to increase in the coming years.</p> <p>The "Others" segment refers to a variety of non-household, non-business applications for sound-absorbing furniture. This includes public spaces such as libraries, schools, healthcare facilities, and entertainment venues, where noise management plays a crucial role in ensuring comfort and productivity. In public spaces, sound-absorbing furniture is used to reduce ambient noise, creating more conducive environments for learning, relaxation, and communication. For instance, in schools, acoustic furniture is designed to reduce background noise in classrooms, making it easier for students to focus and engage with the material.
